Open C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe and click red cross button left side of Apache and MySQL. Make them green check (It's for autorun apache and MySQL) Now start them.

Secure default MySQL user accounts, root and pma through PHPMyAdmin :
Click Mysql >> Admin button from Xampp control panel > User Accounts > Check two of red color “Any” and click “GO” button for remove them.

Now in the row of Username: root and Hostname: localhost , there is a button name => Edit privileges , click it > Change Password & save it

Now go to : C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php and see at the beginning a comment /* Authentication type and info */
After this comment type your password what have you set before

Now replace the first line of ‘config’ to ‘cookie’
Go back to http://localhost/phpmyadmin > set username and pass > User Account > root ::1 > Edit Privileges > Change Password > set pass again and save like before > Back to User Account > root 127.0.0.1 > Edit Privileges > Change Password > again like before.. > Back to User Account > pma localhost > Edit Privileges > Change Pass > again like before
Now go back to C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php and find a comment like 
/* User for advanced features */
And now set password after ‘pma’
Now you can see an error at the end of the page on phpmyadmin like = The secret passphrase in configuration (blowfish_secret) is too short.
Go back to “config.inc.php” and find the keyword “blowfish_secret” mybe it is at the beginning of the file. Now replace the name‘xampp’ to a big jumble keyword like this ‘354fd3sa84df31s68df46sa4df684sadf’ . After that you can see the error has been gone from the phpmyadmin page. And in the “User account” page see the pma localhost password say Yes.

Now copy and paste two of files from crt folder in this directory => C:\xampp\apache\crt

the file "cert.conf" has a domani name "dev.wp" inside of it. you can change inside the all of domane name if you need. 

Now paste below code in C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf (also change domane name if you want)

 <VirtualHost *:80>
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
     ServerName dev.wp
     ServerAlias *.dev.wp
 </VirtualHost>
 <VirtualHost *:443>
     DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
     ServerName dev.wp
     ServerAlias *.dev.wp
     SSLEngine on
     SSLCertificateFile "crt/dev.wp/server.crt"
     SSLCertificateKeyFile "crt/dev.wp/server.key"
 </VirtualHost>

Now double click the "make-cert.bat" file and press enter every time it asking for information. But if you skip it by pressing enter it has defalut value. dont worry. 
After finish this you will get a folder name of domain insite "C:\xampp\apache\crt" location.
